This repository contains the server configuration to host our applications,
currently we deploy the following projects here:

+ [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/lyceum][Lyceum]]

** Developmennt

*** Running Locally (With Qemu)

#+begin_src shell
  nix develop --impure
  # followed by
  run
  # connect to postgres
  sudo --user postgres psql
#+end_src

** Deployment

*** Provisioning with Terraform

#+begin_src shell
  just update-vars
  just plan
  just apply
  # if you need to nuke the infra as well
  just destroy
#+end_src

After the initial terraform deploy, make sure to run:
#+begin_src shell
  just rekey
#+end_src

*** Deploying with Nix

After provisioning the infrastructure, you won't need Terraform anymore, all
deploys can be done in pure Nix.

#+begin_src shell
  just deploy
  # or
  deploy
#+end_src

* Acknowledgements

+ The Terraform-based bootstrap is a modification from the great setup found in the
  [[https://github.com/Gabriella439/nixos-in-production][NixOS in Production]] book.
+ Many thanks to @Misterio77 for [[https://jaxy.discourse.group/t/criando-um-servidor-de-factorio-100-declarativo-com-nixos-e-terraform/48][figuring it out]] how to run this on Magalu cloud.
