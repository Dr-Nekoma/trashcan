** Running Locally (With Qemu)

#+begin_src shell
  nix develop --impure
  # followed by
  run
  # connect to postgres
  sudo --user postgres psql
#+end_src

** Provisioning with Terraform

#+begin_src shell
  just update-vars
  just plan
  just apply
  # if you need to nuke the infra as well
  just destroy
#+end_src

After the initial terraform deploy, make sure to get the new key generated at
~id_ed25519.pub~ and place it under the ~server~ value in ~./secrets/secrets.nix~.

Then run:
#+begin_src shell
  just rekey
#+end_src

** Deploying with Nix

After provisioning the infrastructure, you won't need Terraform anymore, all
deploys can be done in pure Nix.

#+begin_src shell
  just deploy
  # or
  deploy
#+end_src
